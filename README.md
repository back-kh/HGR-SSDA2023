# SSDA2023 Historical Image Explorers

Welcome to the repository for the SSDA 2023 challenge by the Historical Image Explorers team at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. This project focuses on recognizing German historical documents using advanced document image recognition techniques.

## Overview
This repository is designed for researchers and developers working with small historical datasets. Our goal is to provide resources that help train models to accurately recognize text in under-resourced historical collections.

## Key Features
- **Sample Code**: Step-by-step examples demonstrating recognition tasks for German historical documents.
- **Specialized Datasets**: Curated small datasets prepared for efficient model training.
- **Training Tips**: Guidance on handling limited data in historical image analysis.

## Repository Contents
- `Binary-TROCR.ipynb` and `RGB-TROCR.ipynb`: Notebooks for experimenting with different input representations.
- `Binary_train_with_AUG.ipynb`: Training notebook that includes simple augmentation.
- `pre-processing.zip`: Scripts for preparing data.
- `README.txt`: Notes about training challenges on limited hardware.

## Getting Started
Contributions from the community are welcome. If you have additional datasets, model improvements, or innovative techniques, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Acknowledgements
This work is part of the ongoing efforts of the Historical Image Explorers team. We appreciate any feedback or contributions that help advance historical document recognition.
